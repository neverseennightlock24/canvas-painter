# canvas-painter
Creates unique and distinct fractal arts using a series of pre-decided RGB colours

The way this works is randomly generating 20 squares (you can view the original version of this program for more insight into that) followed by repeating that pattern at a 90 degree rotation, before repeating that whole pattern again etc. forming a new fractal until it hits the edge of the screen. Resizing the display window will therefore restart the program. Once it hits the edge, a new 20 square fractal in a different colour is generated and repeated like before.
